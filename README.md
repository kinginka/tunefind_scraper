# Tunefind Scraper

-------

This is a simple data scraping application for scraping Information of Soundtracks from TV shows and movies from [Tunefind](tunefind.com). This app also gathers Youtube video links of the soundtracks.
The mini-project/one day code sprint was to outline the feasibility and scope of the task. 

Future Scope may include:

1. Generating *OST* playlists for shows and movies on Youtube.
2. Scraped information can be filtered and partially extracted for further use.
3. Third-party API compatibility to consume the scraped data/ generate playlists in music streaming services like Youtube music, Apple music, or Spotify.
